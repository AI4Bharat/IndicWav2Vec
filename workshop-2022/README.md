# IndicWav2Vec-Workshop-2022

In this workshop, we will finetune [wav2vec2]() style model from scratch on custom asr data using [Fairseq]() library. We will also train an n-gram language model using [Kenlm]() library. Finally we will export it to Huggingface's format and deploy it as a web app using [Gradio](). 

## Notebooks

Details and step-by-step walkthrough of training, exporting and deploying Indicwav2vec models have been outlined in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/IndicWav2Vec/blob/main/workshop-2022/notebooks/IndicWav2Vec_Workshop_2022.ipynb). 

## Slides

Discussion on topics like ASR Pipeline, Wav2Vec2 Architecture, Role of LM in ASR, Mining Parallel Data, etc.  can be found [here]()
